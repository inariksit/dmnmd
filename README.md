# `dmnmd`: A Command-Line Interface to DMN Decision Tables In Plain Text

> Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious." -- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man Month (1975)

The semantics are DMN.

The syntax is Markdown.

(Hence the name; apologies to any aibohphobes.)

The input is plain-text.

The output is JS. (And, in future, XML, Python, English, LegalRuleML...)

The interface is CLI. No mouse needed!
